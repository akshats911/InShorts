<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to InShorts News Summarizer! In this project I aim to provide you with a convenient way to fetch and summarize the latest news from the web using state-of-the-art NLP models. With a concise summary, you can stay updated on current events quickly and efficiently.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Introduction

In a world overflowing with information, it's essential to stay informed while managing your time effectively. This project automates the process of web scraping to gather the latest news and then leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models from Hugging Face to generate concise news summaries. It's a time-saving solution for busy individuals who want to keep up with the news.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Features

- Web scraping to collect the latest news from multiple sources.
- Utilizes Hugging Face's NLP models for news summarization.
- Provides summarized news in a structured format for easy consumption.
- Scalable and adaptable for different use cases.
- Open Source for you to give your valuable updates and fix any bugs you find



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## CI/CD Pipelines

I aim to use <strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</strong> pipelines for this project. They enable automated testing, building, and deployment of a project. CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality and ensure that the latest version of the application is always available to users.

In this project, I wish to use CI/CD pipelines to:

- Automate testing to catch and fix issues early in the development process.
- Build and package the application for deployment.
- Deploy the application to AWS.

This ensures that the project is always up to date, reliable, and ready for use.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Deployment on ![AWS]

I plan to deploy this project on <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> to take advantage of its robust cloud infrastructure and scalability. AWS offers various services that can be utilized to host web applications, including EC2 for virtual machines, S3 for storing data and static assets, and Lambda for serverless functions. The deployment on AWS tightly integrates with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that any updates or changes are automatically deployed to the AWS environment.
